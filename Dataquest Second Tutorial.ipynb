    "The first, and easiest, thing we can do to improve the accuracy of the random forest is to increase the number of trees we're using. Training more trees will take more time, but because of the fact that we're averaging many predictions made on different subsets of the data, having more trees will increase accuracy greatly (up to a point).\n",

Because of how a decision tree works (as we explained in the video), having splits that go all the way down, or overly deep in the tree can result in fitting to quirks in the dataset, and not true signal. Thus, increasing min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf can reduce overfitting, which will actually improve our score, as we're making predictions on unseen data. A model that is less overfit, and that can generalize better, will actually perform better on unseen data, but worse on seen data.\n",

    "Another method that builds on decision trees is a gradient boosting classifier. Boosting involves training decision trees one after another, and feeding the errors from one tree into the next tree. So each tree is building on all the other trees that came before it. This can lead to overfitting if we build too many trees, though. As you get above 100 trees or so, it's very easy to overfit and train to quirks in the dataset. As our dataset is extremely small, we'll limit the tree count to just 25.\n",

    "Generally, the more diverse the models we ensemble, the higher our accuracy will be. Diversity means that the models generate their results from different columns, or use a very different method to generate predictions. Ensembling a random forest classifier with a decision tree probably won't work extremely well, because they are very similar. On the other hand, ensembling a linear regression with a random forest can work very well.\n",
